                <p>Hans is a top down shooter that was created over a short period. Over the two weeks spent on the
                    project,
                    tremendous focus was
                    put on not only having a playable game as soon as possible, but having a game that *felt*
                    profesional.

                    <br>
                    There are a plethora of unique systems that were created and challenges that were overcome during
                    the development
                    cycle.

                <p>Consistent with modern Unity games, Hans is written entirely in C#. Another primary focus from both a
                    programming
                    and design perspective was writing clean code that could easily be reused in future projects. Hans
                    utilizes a custom
                    event system that expands on the already powerful default Unity Event System. The customizability
                    that this adds to
                    a dynamic and fast-paced game like Hans is a handy tool that is void of but a few dependencies,
                    allowing it to
                    be reused in the future,
                    regardless of type or scope of the project.
